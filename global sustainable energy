 #  ☀️ A Streamlit-powered data app focused on global sustainable energy trends!

This interactive web app is designed to explore and visualize critical topics like: • Electricity access disparities across the globe • Renewable energy adoption patterns • CO₂ emissions and how they’ve changed over time • The impact of GDP, geography, and policy on sustainable energy outcomes

Key Features: • Clean, intuitive UI with multi-tab navigation • Dynamic, interactive charts using Plotly & Seaborn • Time-series analysis and choropleth maps • Correlation heatmaps to uncover impactful relationships • Highlights of countries successfully reducing carbon emissions

Why this matters: Energy equity and sustainability are not just data points but they reflect the quality of life, economic opportunity, and climate resilience for billions of people. With this project, I aimed to bridge insights from data with storytelling to spark awareness and action.

Technologies Used: Streamlit, Python, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
